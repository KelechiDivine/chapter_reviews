I created this asterisks file 
So here is the brief history of this file 

1: This asterisks code can print stars in form of a right angle triangle
2: This file doesn't have any unit testing because it's not a function
3: This file is a statement without a function,, so it might break If handled carelessly.

 Thanks for reading my files.. Hope to see you correct me.
